# Serial-Communication-for-PC410
PC410 is a kind of sensor of temperature and can be controlled by this software using VB.NET

I recently purchased an Altec 900 PC410 controller. I was quite surprised to find no open source software out there, save this program. It's short, simple, and is a nice skeleton to build on. I forked it, translated every Chinese string to English. It builds and runs. Now I need to test the communication to my device. That'll ahve to wait until like 4/4/2022 or later. BUSY week ahead.
